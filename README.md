### Bayesian Network GWAS

This package provides comparably efficient procedures to infer the whole causal graph and estimate the total and direct causal effects from different data sources. 

### Requirement

We have tested the vignettes under following environment: 

R = 4.3.1 
pcalg = 2.6-12         
Matrix = 1.6-1.1      
coop = 0.6-3           
graph = 1.80.0         
BiocGenerics = 0.48.0 
igraph = 1.5.1        
dplyr = 1.1.3          
glasso = 1.11          
glassoFast = 1.0.1  

In addition, We strongly recommend you to install the pcalg we provided in the Github repository, as we have revise some of the functions provided in the orignal package.
